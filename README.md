# TSARMINE


### DESCRIPTION

Experimenting with a new accelerometer-based motion tracking system to monitor Alpine permafrost instabilities: application on the Tsarmine rock glacier, Wallis, Switzerland.


### AIMS

* Observe, quantify and model surface movements and destabilizations of alpine permafrost in order to better apprehend their causes and predict catastrophic events
* Test and validate an innovative measuring system utilizing a network oft hree-axis accelerometers dispatched on the surface of alpine permafrost features in order to continuously monitor their movements

### ACHIEVEMENTS

* Installation of 30 measuring devices and a transmitter-receiver on a high-mountain glacier • Mining and cleansing of the data received from the accelerometers
* Designing algorithms to reconstruct missing data and replace outliers
* Designing algorithms for automatic movements detections and quantifications
* Building machine-learning models to apprehend natural causes of the glacier’s surface destabilizations 
* Visual representations and interpretations of the models and forecasts
* Writing scientific documentation of the outcomes

### DATA

* 1-year-long time-series of 30 accelerometers installed on the Tsarmine high-alpine rock glacier (non-public)
* Time-series of meteorological data from the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss (non-public)
* Hourly images from a PERMOS monitoring webcam (non-public)
